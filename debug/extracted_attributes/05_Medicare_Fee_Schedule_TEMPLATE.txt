When determining the amount payable to Provider, any reimbursement terms in this Agreement that are based, in 
whole or in part, on Medicare rates, pricing, fee schedules, or methodologies published or established by CMS, shall 
refer to the per claim paymen t amounts that CMS and a Medicare beneficiary would directly pay to Provider for the 
same items or services under original Medicare Part A or Part B. The amount payable to Provider shall not include any 
bonus payment or settlement amount paid to Provider b y CMS outside of the Medicare per claim payment process, 
unless otherwise set forth in the Medicare Advantage reimbursement terms of this Agreement. Unless  notifies 
Provider otherwise, in the event CMS changes payment to Provider due to a CMS directive, Act of Congress, Executive 
Order, other governmental pronouncement, or Regulatory Requirement, the amount payable to Provider hereunder will 
automatically be changed as soon as reasonably practicable, as described herein, in the amount specified by CMS as 
a result of such directive or change in law, or in the absence of such specification, in the same percentage amount as 
payment is changed by CMS to Provider.

adjust Provider's compensation through a settlement, even if Medicare adjusts its compensation to Provider based on 
a settlement.

payment groupings, or federal and provider -specific factors) that are available in  systems at the time 
 processes the Provider's Claim.  shall not retroactively adjust Provider's compensation for previously 
processed Claims to reconcile any difference with the payment system logic and data being used by Medicare on the 
same processing date for the same date of servic e. In addition,  shall not retroactively adjust Provider's 
compensation for previously processed claims to reflect Medicare's retroactive updates or changes to payment system 
logic and data.  Provider shall not request adjustments solely based on these differences,
