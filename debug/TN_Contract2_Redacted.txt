Provider to submit with respect to such dispute.  If the total amount in dispute as set forth in the
demand letter is less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), exclusive of interest, costs,
and attorneys' fees, then within twenty (20) days following the date on which the receiving party
receives the demand letter, representatives of each party's choosing shall meet to discuss the
dispute in person or telephonically in an effort to resolve the dispute.  If the total amount in dispute
as set forth in the demand letter is two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) or more, exclusive of
interest, costs, and attorneys' fees, then within ninety (90) days following the date of the demand
letter, the parties shall engage in non-binding mediation in an effort to resolve the dispute unless
both parties agree in writing to waive the mediation requirement.  The parties shall mutually agree
upon a mediator, and failing to do so, Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS") shall be
authorized to appoint a mediator.
7.2 Arbitration
. Any dispute within the scope of subsection 7.1.1 that remains unresolved at the conclusion of the
applicable process outlined in subsection 7.1.1 shall be resolved by binding arbitration in the manner as set
forth below.  Except to the extent as set forth below, the arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, provided, however, that the parties may agree in writing
to further modify the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.  The parties agree to be
bound by the findings of the arbitrator(s) with respect to such dispute, subject to the right of the parties to
appeal such findings as set forth herein.  No arbitration demand shall be filed until after the parties have
completed the dispute resolution efforts described in section 7.1 above.  If the dispute resolution efforts
described in section 7.1 cannot be completed within the deadlines specified for such efforts despite the
parties' good faith efforts to meet such deadlines, such deadlines may be extended as necessary upon
mutual agreement of the parties.  Enforcement of this arbitration clause, including the waiver of class
actions, shall be determined under the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), including the FAA's preemptive effect
on state law.  The parties agree that the arbitration shall be conducted on a confidential basis pursuant to
Rule 26 of the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.  Subject to any disclosures that
may be required or requested under Regulatory Requirements, the parties further agree that they shall
maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration, including without limitation, the existence of the arbitration,
information exchanged during the arbitration, and the award of the arbitrator(s).  Nothing in this provision,
however,  shall  preclude  either  party  from  disclosing  any  such  details  regarding  the  arbitration  to  its
accountants, auditors, brokers, insurers, reinsurers or retrocessionaires.
7.2.1 Location of Arbitration
.  The arbitration hearing shall be held in county and state where 
is located. Notwithstanding the foregoing, both parties can agree in writing to hold the arbitration
hearing in some other location.

7.2.2 Selection and Replacement of Arbitrator(s) .  If the total amount in dispute is less than four million
dollars ($4,000,000), exclusive of interest, costs, and attorneys' fees, the dispute shall be decided
by a single arbitrator selected, and replaced when required, in the manner described in the JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.  If the total amount in dispute is four million
dollars ($4,000,000) or more, exclusive of interest, costs, and attorneys' fees, the dispute shall be
decided by an arbitration panel consisting of three (3) arbitrators, unless the parties agree in writing
that the dispute shall be decided by a single arbitrator.
7.2.3 Appeal .  If the total amount of the arbitration award is five million dollars ($5,000,000) or more,
inclusive of interest, costs, and attorneys' fees, or if the arbitrator(s) issues an injunction against a
party, the parties shall have the right to appeal the decision of the arbitrator(s) pursuant to the
JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure.  A decision that has been appealed shall not be
enforceable while the appeal is pending.  In reviewing a decision of the arbitrator(s), the appeal
panel shall apply the same standard of review that a United States Court of Appeals would apply in
reviewing a similar decision issued by a United States District Court in the jurisdiction in which the
arbitration hearing was held.
7.2.4 Waiver of Certain Claims
.  The parties, on behalf of themselves and those that they may now or
hereafter represent, each agree to and do hereby waive any right to join or consolidate claims in
arbitration by or against other individuals or entities or to pursue, on a class basis, any dispute;
provided however, if there is a dispute regarding the applicability or enforcement of the waiver
provision in this subsection 7.2.4, that dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.
If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such waiver is unenforceable for any reason
with respect to a particular dispute, then the parties agree that section 7.2 shall not apply to such
dispute and that such dispute shall be decided instead in a court of competent jurisdiction.
7.2.5 Limitations on Injunctive Relief
.  The parties, on behalf of themselves and those that they may now
or hereafter represent, each agree that any injunctive relief sought against the other party shall be
limited to the conduct relevant to the parties to the arbitration and shall not be sought for the benefit
of individuals or entities who are not parties to the arbitration.  The arbitrator(s) are not authorized
to issue injunctive relief for the benefit of an individual or entity who is not a party to the arbitration.
The  arbitrator  shall  be  limited  to  issuing  injunctive  relief  related  to  the  specific  issues  in  the
arbitration.
7.3 Attorney's Fees and Costs
. The shared fees and costs of the non-binding mediation and arbitration (e.g. fee
of the mediator, fee of the independent arbitrator) will be shared equally between the parties.  Each party
shall be responsible for the payment of its own specific fees and costs (e.g. the party's own attorney's fees,
the fees of the party selected arbitrator, etc.) and any costs associated with conducting the non-binding
mediation  or  arbitration  that  the  party  chooses  to  incur  (e.g.  expert  witness  fees,  depositions,  etc.).
Notwithstanding this provision, the arbitrator may issue an order in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure Rule 11.

Appendix. Subsequently measurement periods will begin as defined by 
Episode Provider Stop-loss: A methodology that will be incorporated into the Total Episode Cost calculation that is
designed to limit significant provider risk under the episode of care model. The Episode Provider Stop-loss is not

 defined threshold levels for Quality Indicators Linked to Gain Sharing.
Quality Indicators Linked To Gain Sharing : The set of indicators that will be used for determination of quality
certification of each episode. These quality indicators will be based on clinically appropriate and evidence-based
practice. Applicable quality indicator definitions and measurement specifications will be published with each episode.
The thresholds for Quality Indicators Linked to Gain Sharing, represent the minimum score required to meet the
metric. Quality results equal to or higher than the threshold are considered to have met the requirements for the

days of receipt of the reconsideration.
Steps for submitting a written reconsideration request:
Reconsideration requests need to be sent in writing to  via mail or email: Mail:  Community
Care
Attn: Provider Relations — Episodes of Care 22 Century Blvd., Suite 220
Nashville, TN 37214
Email: agpepisode.reporting@ com
Please provide a detailed rationale to support the reconsideration request to include:
 Identification of each performance result (payment and metrics) to be reconsidered
 Identification of the contested result calculated
 A detailed explanation of why the Provider believes the determination is incorrect
 Any other relevant information to support the Provider's reconsideration request
If  the  Quarterback  does  not  object  in writing to a final  reconsideration  within 30  days  following  the receipt  of
 reconciliation report, the Quarterback will be deemed to have accepted such reconciliation
If a Provider is dissatisfied with the result of the reconsideration process or if  fails to respond to the
reconsideration request within 30 days from the received date of the payment dispute, the Provider may submit a
Provider Complaint about specific claims or an episode directly to TDCI. This is an option instead of starting the
independent review process which is detailed below. To submit a Provider Complaint to TDCI the Provider will access
the Provider Complaint Form:  Program Episode of Care Cycle, Provider Gain/Risk Share Total Complaint.
Instructions  for  completing  the  form  can  be  obtained  on  the  State  website,
https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/commerce/documents/tcoversight/forms/
PROVIDERCOMPLAINTEOCFORM111416.pdf.  TDCI will process the complaint within a few days of receipt and
allow  30 calendar days to investigate and respond accordingly. This process is estimated to take no
longer than 40 days. However, please note that unlike the independent review protocol, this process is informal and
not binding for either party.
The Provider may also submit concerns to the Commissioner of the Department of Commerce and Insurance for an
independent review of the disputed claims as set forth in T.C.A. 56-32-126. The Independent Review Process is
available to Providers to resolve episodes of care disputes. It is understood that in the event Providers file a request
with the Commissioner for independent review the dispute, shall be governed by T.C.A. 56-32-126(b).

MEDICAID (  COMMUNITY CARE)
PARTICIPATION ATTACHMENT TO THE
 
PROVIDER AGREEMENT
This is a Medicaid Participation Attachment ("Attachment") to the  Provider Agreement ("Agreement"),
entered into by and between  and Provider and is incorporated into the Agreement.
ARTICLE I 
DEFINITIONS
The following definitions shall apply to this Attachment.  Terms not otherwise defined in this Attachment shall carry
the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
All references to "  under this Medicaid Participation Attachment shall mean and refer to 
Tennessee Inc.
"Audit" means a review or audit of any and all obligations, requirements, records and information  set forth in this
Participation Attachment by the entities named herein.
"Clean Claim" means, unless otherwise required by applicable state Regulatory Requirements, an accurate and
timely filed Claim submitted pursuant to this Attachment, that has no defect or impropriety, for which all information
necessary to process such Claim and make a benefit determination is included.  This includes but is not limited to,
the claim being submitted in a nationally accepted format in compliance with standard coding guidelines, and which
does not require adjustment, or alteration by Provider of the services in order to be processed and paid.
"Ethical and Religious Directives (ERDs)" means a document that offers moral guidance on various aspects of health
care delivery and is based on a religious organization's theological and moral teachings.
"Medicaid Covered Services" means, for purposes of this Attachment, only those Covered Services provided under
 Medicaid Program(s), i.e., the package of health care services, including physical health, behavioral
health, and long-term care services, that define the covered services available to  members.
"Medicaid Member" means, for purposes of this Attachment, a Member who is enrolled in  Medicaid
Program(s) under  For all purposes related to this Attachment, including all schedules, exhibits, provider
manual(s),  notices and  communications  related to  this  Attachment,  the  term "Medicaid Member"  may  be  used
interchangeably with the terms  Standard Enrollee,  Medicaid Enrollee, and the meaning of each
is synonymous with any such other unless otherwise stated in this Attachment.
"Medicaid Program(s)" means, for purposes of this Attachment, a medical assistance program provided under a
Health Benefit Plan approved under Title XVI, Title XIX and/or Title XXI of the Social Security Act or any other federal
or state funded program or product as designated by 
"Medically Necessary/Medical Necessity" means:
A Those services that are recommended by a physician or other licensed healthcare provider practicing within
the scope of the physician's license who is treating the Medicaid Member.  A Medically Necessary Medicaid
Covered Service must satisfy each of the following criteria:
(i) It must be required in order to diagnose or treat a Medicaid Member's medical condition. The
convenience of a Medicaid Member, a Medicaid Member's family, or a provider shall not be a factor
or justification in determining that a medical item or service is Medically Necessary;
Tennessee Enterprise Provider Agreement Medicaid Attachment
© 2019 Dec –   Tennessee, Inc. v.2
06/04/2021
33 #

(ii) It must be safe and effective. To qualify as safe and effective, the type and level of medical item or
service must be consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis and treatment of the particular medical
condition, and the reasonably anticipated medical benefits of the item or service must outweigh the
reasonably anticipated medical risks based on the Medicaid Member's condition and scientifically
supported evidence;
(iii) It must be the least costly alternative course of diagnosis or treatment that is adequate for the
medical condition of the Medicaid Member. When applied to medical items or services delivered in
an inpatient setting, it further means that the medical item or service cannot be safely provided for
the  same  or  lesser  cost  to  the  person  in  an  outpatient  setting.  Where  there  are  less  costly
alternative courses of diagnosis or treatment, including less costly alternative settings that are
adequate for the medical condition of the Medicaid Member, more costly alternative courses of
diagnosis or treatment are not Medically Necessary. An alternative course of diagnosis or treatment
may include observation, lifestyle or behavioral changes or, where appropriate, no treatment at all;
and
(iv) It  must  not  be  experimental  or  investigational.  A  medical  item  or  service  is  experimental  or
investigational if there is inadequate empirically-based objective clinical scientific evidence of its
safety and effectiveness for the particular use in question. This standard is not satisfied by a
provider's subjective clinical judgment on the safety and effectiveness of a medical item or service
or by a reasonable medical or clinical hypothesis based on an extrapolation from use in another
setting or from use in diagnosing or treating another condition such as:
(a) Use of a drug or biological product that has not been approved under a new drug
application for marketing by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
is deemed experimental; or
(b) Use of a drug or biological product that has been approved for marketing by the FDA
but is proposed to be used for other than the FDA-approved purpose.  It will not be
deemed Medically Necessary unless the use can be shown to be widespread, to be
generally accepted by the professional medical community as an effective and proven
treatment in the setting and for the condition for which it is used, and to satisfy the
requirements of subdivisions (A)(i) – (A)(iii).
B It is the responsibility of the Medicaid Program ultimately to determine what medical items and services are
Medically Necessary for the Medicaid Program. The fact that a provider has prescribed, recommended or
approved a medical item or service does not, in itself, make such item or service Medically Necessary.   In
the  case  of  enrollees  under  21  years  of  age,  services  shall  be  provided  in  accordance  with  EPSDT
requirements  including federal regulations as described in 42 CFR Part 441, Subpart B, and the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989.
"State Agency," if used, means a federal, state or local agency, administration, board or other governing body with
jurisdiction over the governance or administration of a Medicaid Program.
"Subcontract" means a contract to perform or assist, even if incidentally or in an auxiliary capacity, in the performance
of all or part of the Provider's duties or obligations under the Agreement and/or this Attachment.  An agreement
entered into by the Provider with any other organization or person who agrees to perform any administrative function
or service for the Provider specifically related to securing or fulfilling the Provider's obligations to  under
the terms of this Attachment when the intent of such an agreement is to delegate the responsibility for any major

Assembly for the State of Tennessee does not authorize the State agencies or employees to
provide,  carry, or maintain  commercial General Liability Insurance  or Medical, Professional or
Hospital Liability Insurance. Claims against the State of Tennessee, or its employees, for injury,
damages,  expenses  or  attorney's  fees  are  heard  and  determined  by  the  Tennessee  Claims
Commission or the Tennessee Board of Claims in the manner prescribed by law. See Tenn. Code
Ann. §§ 8-42-101 et seq., 9-8-101 et seq., 9-8-301 et seq., and 9-8-410 et seq. Provider as a

5.31.2 If the Provider is a local government owned and operated: The Provider, being a Tennessee local
governmental  entity  (such  as  a  county  or  municipality),  is  governed  by  the  provisions  of  the
Tennessee Government Tort Liability Act, Tennessee Code Annotated, Sections 29-20-101 et seq.,
for causes of action sounding in tort.  Further, no contract provision requiring a Tennessee political
entity to indemnify or hold harmless the State beyond the liability imposed by law is enforceable
because it appropriates public money and nullifies governmental immunity without the authorization
of the General Assembly. Provider as a governmental entity is not required to provide workers
compensation insurance.  If the Provider does not maintain workers compensation insurance it
does, however, provide a fully funded injured on duty benefit program for its employees.

qualifies as an "employee" in accordance with Section 224 (g) of the Public Health Service Act
("PHS"), located at 42 U.S.C. § 223(g), as amended, Provider shall have its liability limits defined
by Section 224(a) of the Federal Tort Claims Act. As an employee under the PHS, Provider carries
no professional liability insurance; however, it is insured for general liability. This general liability
insurance is for the benefit of the Provider only and provides no indemnification for any other entity
whatsoever. The Provider agrees to produce proof of adequate professional liability insurance for
the  Provider's  professional  employees  who  perform  any  professional  services  under  this
Agreement  and  are  not  covered  by  the  Federal  Tort  Claims  Act.  To  the  extent  required  by
Regulatory Requirements, Provider shall maintain workers' compensation insurance for Provider's
employees. In the event that Provider loses its status as an "employee" pursuant to Section 224(g)
of the PHS, Provider shall maintain professional liability insurance, including maintaining such tail
or prior acts coverage necessary to avoid any gap in coverage for claims arising from incidents
occurring during the term of this Agreement.  Such insurance shall (i) be obtained from a carrier
authorized to issue coverage in the jurisdiction in which Provider operates, except for permitted
self-insurance; and (ii) maintain minimum policy limits equal to $1,000,000.00 per occurrence and
$3,000,000.00 in the aggregate, or such other coverage amounts as prescribed by applicable
Regulatory Requirements and consented to by   Provider shall maintain general liability
insurance covering Provider's premises, insuring Provider against any claim of loss, liability, or
damage caused by or arising out of the condition or alleged condition of said premises, or the
furniture, fixtures, appliances, or equipment located therein, and if Provider operates motor vehicles
in connection with Provider's services, with liability protection against any loss, liability or damage
resulting from the operation of such motor vehicles by Provider, Provider's employees or agents.
Such general liability insurance shall contain commercially reasonable coverage limits, or such
limits as prescribed by Regulatory Requirements.
