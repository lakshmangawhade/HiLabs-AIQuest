Those services that are recommended by a physician or other licensed healthcare provider practicing within\nthe scope of the physician's license who is treating the Medicaid Member.  A Medically Necessary Medicaid\nCovered Service must satisfy each of the following criteria:\n(i) It must be required in order to diagnose or treat a Medicaid Member's medical condition. The\nconvenience of a Medicaid Member, a Medicaid Member's family, or a provider shall not be a factor\nor justification in determining that a medical item or service is Medically Necessary;\n(ii) It must be safe and effective. To qualify as safe and effective, the type and level of medical item or\nservice must be consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis and treatment of the particular medical\ncondition, and the reasonably anticipated medical benefits of the item or service must outweigh the\nreasonably anticipated medical risks based on the Medicaid Member's condition and scientifically\nsupported evidence;\n(iii) It must be the least costly alternative course of diagnosis or treatment that is adequate for the\nmedical condition of the Medicaid Member. When applied to medical items or services delivered in\nan inpatient setting, it further means that the medical item or service cannot be safely provided for\nthe  same  or  lesser  cost  to  the  person  in  an  outpatient  setting.  Where  there  are  less  costly\nalternative courses of diagnosis or treatment, including less costly alternative settings that are\nadequate for the medical condition of the Medicaid Member, more costly alternative courses of\ndiagnosis or treatment are not Medically Necessary. An alternative course of diagnosis or treatment\nmay include observation, lifestyle or behavioral changes or, where appropriate, no treatment at all;\nand\n(iv) It  must  not  be  experimental  or  investigational.  A  medical  item  or  service  is  experimental  or\ninvestigational if there is inadequate empirically-based objective clinical scientific evidence of its\nsafety and effectiveness for the particular use in question. This standard is not satisfied by a\nprovider's subjective clinical judgment on the safety and effectiveness of a medical item or service\nor by a reasonable medical or clinical hypothesis based on an extrapolation from use in another\nsetting or from use in diagnosing or treating another condition such as:\n(a) Use of a drug or biological product that has not been approved under a new drug\napplication for marketing by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and\nis deemed experimental; or\n(b) Use of a drug or biological product that has been approved for marketing by the FDA\nbut is proposed to be used for other than the FDA-approved purpose.  It will not be\ndeemed Medically Necessary unless the use can be shown to be widespread, to be\ngenerally accepted by the professional medical community as an effective and proven\ntreatment in the setting and for the condition for which it is used, and to satisfy the\nrequirements of subdivisions (A)(i) – (A)(iii).\nB. It is the responsibility of the Medicaid Program ultimately to determine what medical items and services are \nMedically Necessary for the Medicaid Program.

To submit a Provider Complaint to TDCI the Provider will access\nthe Provider Complaint Form:  Program Episode of Care Cycle, Provider Gain/Risk Share Total Complaint.\nInstructions  for  completing  the  form  can  be  obtained  on  the  State  website,\nhttps://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/commerce/documents/tcoversight/forms/\nPROVIDERCOMPLAINTEOCFORM111416.pdf.  TDCI will process the complaint within a few days of receipt and\nallow  30 calendar days to investigate and respond accordingly. This process is estimated to take no longer\nthan 40 days. However, please note that unlike the independent review protocol, this process is informal and not\nbinding for either party.\nThe Provider may also submit concerns to the Commissioner of the Department of Commerce and Insurance for an\nindependent review of the disputed claims as set forth in T.C.A. 56-32-126. The Independent Review Process is\navailable to Providers to resolve episodes of care disputes.

Those services that are recommended by a physician or other licensed healthcare provider practicing within\nthe scope of the physician's license who is treating the Medicaid Member.  A Medically Necessary Medicaid\nCovered Service must satisfy each of the following criteria:\n(i) It must be required in order to diagnose or treat a Medicaid Member's medical condition. The\nconvenience of a Medicaid Member, a Medicaid Member's family, or a provider shall not be a factor\nor justification in determining that a medical item or service is Medically Necessary;\n(ii) It must be safe and effective. To qualify as safe and effective, the type and level of medical item or\nservice must be consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis and treatment of the particular medical\ncondition, and the reasonably anticipated medical benefits of the item or service must outweigh the\nreasonably anticipated medical risks based on the Medicaid Member's condition and scientifically\nsupported evidence;\n(iii) It must be the least costly alternative course of diagnosis or treatment that is adequate for the\nmedical condition of the Medicaid Member. When applied to medical items or services delivered in\nan inpatient setting, it further means that the medical item or service cannot be safely provided for\nthe  same  or  lesser  cost  to  the  person  in  an  outpatient  setting.  Where  there  are  less  costly\nalternative courses of diagnosis or treatment, including less costly alternative settings that are\nadequate for the medical condition of the Medicaid Member, more costly alternative courses of\ndiagnosis or treatment are not Medically Necessary. An alternative course of diagnosis or treatment\nmay include observation, lifestyle or behavioral changes or, where appropriate, no treatment at all;\nand\n(iv) It  must  not  be  experimental  or  investigational.  A  medical  item  or  service  is  experimental  or\ninvestigational if there is inadequate empirically-based objective clinical scientific evidence of its\nsafety and effectiveness for the particular use in question. This standard is not satisfied by a\nprovider's subjective clinical judgment on the safety and effectiveness of a medical item or service\nor by a reasonable medical or clinical hypothesis based on an extrapolation from use in another\nsetting or from use in diagnosing or treating another condition such as:\n(a) Use of a drug or biological product that has not been approved under a new drug\napplication for marketing by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and\nis deemed experimental; or\n(b) Use of a drug or biological product that has been approved for marketing by the FDA\nbut is proposed to be used for other than the FDA-approved purpose.  It will not be\ndeemed Medically Necessary unless the use can be shown to be widespread, to be\ngenerally accepted by the professional medical community as an effective and proven\ntreatment in the setting and for the condition for which it is used, and to satisfy the\nrequirements of subdivisions (A)(i) – (A)(iii).\nB. It is the responsibility of the Medicaid Program ultimately to determine what medical items and services are \nMedically Necessary for the Medicaid Program. The fact that a provider has prescribed, recommended or\napproved a medical item or service does not, in itself, make such item or service Medically Necessary.\nMedical Necessity and Medically Necessary as used in the Agreement shall have the meaning contained in\nTenn.
